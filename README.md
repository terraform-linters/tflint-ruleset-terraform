TFLint ruleset plugin for Terraform Language

This ruleset focus on possible errors and best practices about Terraform Language.

## Requirements

- TFLint v0.40+
- Go v1.19

## Installation

This ruleset is built into TFLint, so you usually don't need to worry about how to install it. You can check the built-in version with `tflint -v`:

```
$ tflint -v
TFLint version 0.40.0
+ ruleset.terraform (0.1.0-bundled)
```

If you want to use a version different from the built-in version, you can declare `plugin` in `.tflint.hcl` as follows and install it with `tflint --init`:

```hcl
plugin "terraform" {
    enabled = true
    version = "0.1.0"
    source  = "github.com/terraform-linters/tflint-ruleset-terraform"
}
```

## Rules

See [Rules](docs/rules/README.md).

## Building the plugin

Clone the repository locally and run the following command:

```
$ make
```

You can easily install the built plugin with the following:

```
$ make install
```

Note that if you install the plugin with `make install`, you must omit the `version` and `source` attributes in` .tflint.hcl`:

```hcl
plugin "terraform" {
    enabled = true
}
```
